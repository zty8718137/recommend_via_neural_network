# Recommendation System via Deep neural network
**_Tianyu Zhong_**

A recommendation system is implemented via deep neural network. 
We focused on the solution of cold start problem in the recommendation system. 
We trained a deep neural network via tensorflow, and make the RMSE about 0.78, which is more than 10% lower than matrix factorization based on SVD, and 20% lower than collaborative filtering.
